**Assignment** : Functional Programming

**Questions**

**1.** *Write a Scheme Lisp Program to compute factorial of a natural number.*<br>
**2.** *Write a Scheme Lisp Program to compute N-th Fibonacci Number, where N is a natural number.*<br>
**3.** *Write a Scheme Lisp Program to compute the HCF of two natural numbers N1 and N2 (N1 >= N2).*<br>
**4.** *Write a Scheme Lisp Program to find the largest among N natural numbers.*<br>
**5.** *Write a Scheme Lisp Program to compute the sum of N natural numbers.*<br>
**6.** *Write a Scheme Lisp Program to implement a binary tree and display each node values.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not
need to take inputs from user.* <br>
**Optional** Write a Scheme Lisp Program to compute sum of first N natural numbers.

**Description**

- This is an assignment as part of Programming Paradigms laboratory(CS 453), IIEST.

- This repository contains my solutions to the above problems.<br>
I used repl.it for programming the solutions.<br>
So, effectively, the programs work fine when using BiwaScheme.<br>
In other versions of Scheme, syntax may differ slightly.

Before copying the solutions, check whether doing so would cause plagiarism issues for your work.

**Acknowledgement**<br>
I was stuck with my implementation of question 6. I asked [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55690540/binary-tree-insert-node-procedure-is-not-working-as-desired-scheme) on stackoverflow. Then I corrected my implementation accordingly. <br>
The idea of representing sets as a tree, as discussed by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman in their book Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, is basically the method that I have implemented after receiving a similar method as suggestion in the stackoverflow answer.
