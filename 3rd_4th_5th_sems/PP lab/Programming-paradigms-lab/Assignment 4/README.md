## Objective : 
  1. To learn about inheritance.
  2. To learn about polymorphism.
  3. To learn about some different types of the above and implement them.

   # 1. build
       The object files produced by Makefile are stored here.
       To link them , use g++ 
       The executable a.out is now produced in the same folder.
       ./a.out executes the program.
   
   # 2. include
        Contains header files 
        
   # 3. src
        Contains implementation files and client file main.cpp
        The interaction with user is defined in main.cpp 
        
## Compiler, IDE and OS specifications
    I used Linux subsytem for Windows.
    gcc version 7.3.0 (Ubuntu 7.3.0-27ubuntu1~18.04)
    Visual Studio Code was used for managing the project.
